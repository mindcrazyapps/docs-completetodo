Anyone can help out with translations for Tasks. Please visit [tasks.org/weblate](https://tasks.org/weblate) to get involved. Feel free to add your language if it does not already exist

**Note:** Some strings contain special formatting characters such as '%s', '\n', and '%1$s' that need to be preserved. For example in the string "Task Saved: due %s," %s is a placeholder for the task due date. If you remove these special formatting characters then Tasks will not be able to plug in the necessary values.

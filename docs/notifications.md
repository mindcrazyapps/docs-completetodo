The most common causes of notification trouble are listed below. If your
problem isn't solved here please send me an e-mail by tapping on `☰ > Help &
feedback > Contact developer` and I will help you out!

### Missed notifications appear when I open the app

Some manufacturers terminate background apps to conserve battery. Please visit
[dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) for help disabling your
manufacturer's battery restrictions

### Notifications are late (Android 6+)

Android can delay notifications to conserve battery while your device is idle.
To prevent Android from delaying Tasks' notifications:

1. Tap on `☰ > Settings > Notifications > Disable battery optimizations`
2. Tap on the dropdown and select "All apps"
3. Tap on "Tasks" and select "Don't optimize"

### I disabled battery optimizations and notifications are still late

Please visit [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) and make sure you
have disabled your manufacturer's battery restrictions

### Notifications only appear while the app is open

Please visit [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) and make sure you
have disabled your manufacturer's battery restrictions

### Notifications are silent or do not appear at all (Android 8+)

It is easy to inadvertently silence or disable reminders from the notification
shade. To check your settings tap on `☰ > Settings > Notifications > More
settings`. Make sure `Notifications` are toggled on, then tap on
`Notifications` to configure your ringtone, vibration, and priority

### Notifications don't appear on my watch

Wearable devices will not display persistent reminders. Toggle off `☰ >
Settings > Notifications > Persistent reminders`

### Notifications don't appear on my lock screen

Some lock screens exclude persistent reminders. Toggle off `☰ > Settings >
Notifications > Persistent reminders`

### Notifications still don't work!!!

Open up the navigation drawer, tap on `☰ > Help & feedback > Contact developer` and
let me know!

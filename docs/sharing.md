Tasks' sharing features are under active development!

### Tasks.org account

Currently lists can only be shared with other Tasks.org accounts. In the near
future you will be able to share lists with anyone, even if they don't use
Tasks!

### Google Tasks, DAVx‚Åµ, and the EteSync Android client

Sharing features not supported due to technical limitations

### Nextcloud, ownCloud, and sabre/dav

Sharing features are available when your account is configured to use Tasks'
native CalDAV synchronization

### EteSync

Sharing features will be available for native EteSync synchronization in a
future update

### OpenXchange

Some list sharing features are available for OpenXchange servers. More features
will be added in a future release if possible

### Other CalDAV servers

Sharing support for other CalDAV services may be possible. If you're familiar
with how sharing is implemented in your preferred CalDAV server, please submit
a feature request with the details on [Tasks' issue
tracker](https://github.com/tasks/tasks/issues)

Tasks v11.8 is rolling out to Google Play users. This is the third in a series
of releases bringing [shared list support](/blog/shared-lists-are-coming) to
Tasks.

* You can now invite other users to collaborate on shared lists! This
  functionality requires a Tasks.org account or Tasks' native CalDAV support
  with a compatible server¹. [More information](/docs/sharing)
* Support for Android 6.0 has been dropped. Tasks now requires Android 7+
* EteSync v1 support has been deprecated and will be removed soon! This release
  removes the ability to create new lists, rename lists, change list colors,
  and delete lists. Please [migrate to EteSync
  v2](https://www.etesync.com/user-guide/migrate-v2/), or use the EteSync
  Android client to continue synchronizing EteSync v1 data with Tasks
* Fixed a time zone issue when selecting a 'Repeat until' date in the
  recurrence picker

Shared lists are coming to Tasks! Starting with v11.6, the next several
releases will focus on shared list support. You will soon be able to add and
remove shared users, adjust read and write permissions, and communicate with
shared list members. Best of all, these features will be completely open source
and self-hostable!

Sharing features will only be available for the following sync methods:
* Tasks.org
* [CalDAV](https://tasks.org/caldav)¹
* [EteSync](https://tasks.org/etesync)

Due to technical limitations, sharing is not available for Google Tasks, DAVx⁵,
and the EteSync Android client. Sharing is also not available for DecSync CC or
EteSync v1

[Sign up for beta testing](https://tasks.org/docs/beta) to try out the latest
features now!

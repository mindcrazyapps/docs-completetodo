Tasks v11.7 is rolling out to Google Play users. This is the second in a series
of releases bringing [shared list support](/blog/shared-lists-are-coming) to
Tasks!

* If you synchronize with Tasks.org or use Tasks' native CalDAV support¹:
  * The list settings screen will display shared list members
  * List owners can remove shared list members from the list
* Fixed a time zone issue when selecting a 'Repeat until' date in the
  recurrence picker

technical limitations sharing not available for DAVx⁵

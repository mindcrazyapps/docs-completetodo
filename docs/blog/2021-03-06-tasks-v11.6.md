Tasks v11.6 is rolling out to Google Play users. This is the first in a series
of releases bringing [shared list
support](/blog/shared-lists-are-coming) to Tasks!

* If you synchronize with Tasks.org or use Tasks' native CalDAV support¹:
  * An indicator is displayed next to shared lists
  * Tasks will not upload changes to read-only lists
    ([#931](https://github.com/tasks/tasks/issues/931))
* Unnecessary icon mirroring has been removed for right-to-left device locales
  ([#1385](https://github.com/tasks/tasks/issues/1385) and
  [#1391](https://github.com/tasks/tasks/pull/1391))
